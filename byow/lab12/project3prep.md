# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

don't know.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:

The rooms are hexagons and the hallways are tesselation. 
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:

I would make an add Room method first. 
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:

A hallway connects rooms and could be either 1 or 2 blocks in width and however long, but a room could be a square or rectangular and could range from 1 square to a lot of squares.
